## ðŸš€ About

    Players can use this IP to connect to your Minecraft server, bypassing traditional networking limitations.
    The plugin also supports Discord integration, providing server status updates or notifications directly to your Discord server.

## DynuDNS: Static Domains for Dynamic Ngrok IPs

## Core Functionality
DynuDNS provides permanent domains that automatically update to point at changing Ngrok IP addresses.

#### Technical Flow
1. **Ngrok Assignment**  
   Generates temporary address:  
   `tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345` (IP: `52.31.140.23`)

2. **DynuDNS Binding**  
   Maintains static domain:  
   `mc.example.dynu.com` â†’ `52.31.140.23`

3. **Player Access**  
   Connect via:  
   `mc.example.dynu.com`

### Key Advantages
- **Domain Stability**  
  Single memorable address for players
- **Automatic Updates**  
  IP changes handled without player intervention
- **Zero Cost**  
  Free dynamic DNS service tier available

### Installation
1. DynuDNS account
2. Register domain of your choice (e.g., `example.gleeze.com`) in Dynamic DNS Service
